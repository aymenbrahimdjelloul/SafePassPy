**SecurePass** is a Python library designed to enhance password security by providing tools to assess password strength, detect breaches, and improve security through password salting, random generation, and more. It's simple to integrate into your projects, making it easy to ensure that your passwords are secure.

## **Key Features:**
- **Password Strength Assessment**: Evaluates your passwordâ€™s strength and provides a percentage rating based on established security metrics.
- **Breach Detection**: Checks your password against a large, constantly updated database of breached passwords.
- **Password Crack Time Estimation**: Estimates how long it would take for a password to be cracked through brute-force or other methods.
- **Password Salting**: Adds a random string (salt) to your password before hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks.
